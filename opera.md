## Bugtracker

There is a [Bugtracker](https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/) to report bugs for Opera. The bug
tracker isn't open at the moment. When bugs are fixed, they get noted in release notes - [example](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/changelog-for-31/#b1889.50)

If you want to report a standards support bug, you can also tweet [@odevrel](https://twitter.com/odevrel) to let them know.
